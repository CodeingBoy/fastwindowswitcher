## Background/Similar programs

FastWindowSwitcher is based on the idea of [vimfx](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/vimfx/)/[Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) browser plug-ins to use label to mark a location you want to go next.  During development i found [HerbiClicker](http://herbi.org/HerbiClicker/HerbiClicker.htm), but i was not able to get this program into a working state.
